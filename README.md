#### Kirchhoff's laws for Linear Equations over a circuit modeled in Graphs
The purpose of this software is to implement and exemplify the ideas behind solving electrical circuit networks with graph models described [in this paper](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-4auDHgeayucjNfS205QTdnRWc/edit ), which is also avaiable in TeX files in this repository.

I have no plans to make this software more than a console application. I am not the inventor of this model, so if you implement your own software wit GUI and optimized libraries you owe me nothing... but I would appreciate if you mention my work (mainly the whitepaper) and e-mail me telling about it. I would happily spread the word about a better software.

Yes, I reinvented the wheel and implemented my own matrix and graph classes. The implementation had academic and educational motivation. If you are a professor and have plans of exhibiting this content or the reference paper, please send me an e-mail telling about the experience. It would be an honor.

Feel free to make pull request, and I would appreciate any issues reported.
